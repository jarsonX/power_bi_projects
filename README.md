# MS Power BI Projects

I am a huge fan of MS Power BI. It encouraged me to pursue a more technical-oriented career path, where I learned how to work with databases, write SQL and code. I use Power BI not only as a professional tool, but also as a hobby, exploring and mastering new functionalities. This repository is where I showcase my creativity and expertise!
